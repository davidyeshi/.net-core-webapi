In this folder we'll put all service implementations.

A service class is not a class that should handle data access.
There is apattern called Repository Pattern that is used to manage data from databases.
When using the Repository Pattern, we define repository classes, that basically 
encapsulate all logic to handle data access. These repositories expose methods to list, 
create, edit and delete objects of a given model, the same way you can manipulate 
collections. Internally, these methods talk to the database to perform CRUD operations, 
isolating the database access from the rest of the application.
