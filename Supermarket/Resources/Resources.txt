A resource class is a class that contains only basic information that will be 
exchanged between client applications and API endpoints, generally in form of 
JSON data, to represent some particular information.

All responses from API endpoints must return a resource.

It is a bad practice to return the real model representation as the response 
since it can contain information that the client application does not need or 
that it doesn’t have permission to have (for example, a user model could return 
information of the user password, which would be a big security issue).

We need a resource to represent only our categories, without the products.
